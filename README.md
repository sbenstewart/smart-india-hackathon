On what we are to do here later. Hold on tight.
## The team
Yet to be decided.

## The codebase
For now to keep things simple, I will be using my reliable Jupyter notebook for the tasks to be done.
## Important Note
This is for a competition, and so would not be merging your PRs on this repo but if you are working on the same hackathon make sure that you do not copy to the exact code but you are welcome to build over our idea.<br>
<b>Have a great day :)</b>
